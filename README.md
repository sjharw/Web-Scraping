# Web Scraping
Web scraping is a method of obtaining data from a website.

### Static vs Dynamic
Websites can be static or dynamic. Static websites contain a fixed display, whereas dynamic websites display changes in response to the actions of the user who is accessing the site.

### Tools for web scraping
Beautiful Soup (Soup) is a Python library for pulling data from the HTML of static websites. For dynamic websites, Selenium can be used as it pulls data from HTML after its been rendered, Selenium does this by automating the web-browser.

### Sites to web-scrape
To know whether a website allows web scraping or not, you can look at the website’s “robots.txt” file.
